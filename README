dotfiles from my linux setup.

Some of these files are quite messy, and contain stuff I have gathered 
over the years. I will sort them out one day. Maybe.

Run the script provided to symlink each dotfile to home dir. 
But be careful, the script is very basic and it may cause problems. It worked
for me though.
