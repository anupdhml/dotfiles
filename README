dotfiles from my linux setup.

Some of these files are quite messy, and contain stuff I have gathered 
over the years. I will sort them out one day. Maybe.

Just copy the dotfile to your home folder and tweak. Or you may choose to run 
the script provided and symlink each dotfile to your home folder.
But be careful, the script is very basic and it may cause problems. It worked
for me though.
